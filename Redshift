Redshift
###################
It is columnar datawarehouse used for OLAP systems.

--> Architecture
	1 leader node, multiple compute nodes
	Leader node
		has the SQL endpoint
		coordinates parallel query execution
	Compute node
		queries are executed in parallel in multiple nodes
		scale out / up/ down
		10 GBs network
	Runs in a single AZ (high-speed network communication)
	Instance types: dc2 (dense compute), and dense storage (ds2)
	Data stored on multiple nodes, dedicated CPU, memory and local storage
--> Redshift integrations in AWS:
	COPY command
		to load data from:S3,DynamoDB.
		includes reference to IAM role.
		
--> Table Design
	Distribution styles
		Even (default): rows distributed accross slices regardless of values in a particular column. 
		Key: Used to optimize JOINs. same key should be in the same slice to be faster. Values are hashed, same value goes to same location.
		All: Full table data goes to the first slice of every node
		Auto: Combines EVEN and ALL.
