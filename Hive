1. SMB Join in Hive
	In Hive, while each mapper reads a bucket from the first table and the corresponding bucket from the second table, in SMB join. It is useful when tables are large. Limitation: Both tables should have same number of buckets.

2. What is serde?
	Serde in Hive is used for I/O.
	Serialization — Process of converting an object in memory into bytes that can be stored in a file or transmitted over a network.
	Deserialization — Process of converting the bytes back into an object in memory.

8. How To Convert External table to Internal table or vice-versa in Big Data Hadoop
	Use the following command to convert an external table to an internal table:
    	use <db name>;
    	ALTER TABLE <tablename> SET TBLPROPERTIES('EXTERNAL'='FALSE');
	Use the following command to convert an internal table to an external table:
    	use <db name>;
    	ALTER TABLE <tablename> SET TBLPROPERTIES('EXTERNAL'='TRUE');
9. Write hive table create statement for below given data.
	SrNo|Name|Age|Sal

	Name                 string,
	Age                 int
	sal		    int
	)
	ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
	**TBLPROPERTIES('serialization.null.format'='' , skip.header.line.count"="1);**

	Select teamA from teams
	union all
	Select teamB from teams) group by teamA)
	left join

	on team=team_won;
	
12. How can you perform update or delete operation on a table?
	ACID properties are supported by HIVE managed table only. We have to create a managed table with below properties:
	i. Hive tables should be created with TRANSACTIONAL table property. TBLPROPERTIES (‘transactional’=’true’)
	ii. Hive supports ACID transactions on tables that store ORC file format.
	iii. one of the important property need to know is hive.txn.manager which is used to set Hive Transaction manager, by default hive uses DummyTxnManager, to enable ACID, we need to set it to DbTxnManager.
	
13. Scenario:
	Table A
	Name	Salary
	ABC		5000
	MNP		6000

	Table B
	Name	Salary
	ABC		8000
	XYZ		6000

	output
	Name	Salary
	ABC		8000
	MNP		6000
	XYZ		6000
